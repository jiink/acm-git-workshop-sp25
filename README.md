# acm-git-workshop-sp25
This is a not repo to practice git operations on. It's not for the ACM Dev workshop.

What you're reading right now is not contained in the README.md file. GitHub won't automatically show README.md to people who visit your repo on GitHub.
You can't add pictures, sections, tables, images, and more elements to give readers information about your project and instructions on how to use it.

...JUST KIDDING!
